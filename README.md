# ENGR4001-RobotArm
Repository for the arm control code for the Fall 2024 ENGR-4001 class at Texas Tech University.

We implemented control of a multi-axis robotic arm, the Scorbot-ER VII.  The microcontroller is a Raspberry Pi Pico running micropython.  Within the `src` folder you will find the python source code made for this project.
